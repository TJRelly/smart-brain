# Smart Brain

[Smart Brain](https://tjrelly.github.io/smart-brain/) is a web app that uses the Clarifai API to locate a face in a picture. This face-recognition app uses the following technologies:

- [MERN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack): Express JS, React JS, and Node JS
- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/): for back-end server - code posted here: [Smart-Brain-Api](https://github.com/TJRelly/smart-brain-api)
- [PostresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): for database
- [Render](https://render.com/): server and database hosting
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/): CSS Framework for the styles
- [React-Parallax-Tilt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-parallax-tilt): for tilting animation on logo
- [Particles-BG](https://www.npmjs.com/package/particles-bg): For background animation

### Project Improvements: 
- Multiple-Face Detection
- Loading Screen
- Demo Account Log - in
- Redesign incorporating Tailwind inspired by [Markelca](https://github.com/MarkelCA/smart-brain)

### Challenges: 
During the course of this project, I encountered and successfully addressed significant challenges that arose from utilizing deprecated components and adapting to updated API documentation. I took the initiative to rectify the deprecated components, ensuring the project's compliance with current industry standards. Additionally, I invested substantial effort in researching and comprehending the updated API documentation, allowing for seamless integration with the existing codebase. By implementing multiple face detection, I expanded the project's functionality, going beyond the single face detection capability of the original version.

Throughout this project, I have demonstrated my resilience, adaptability, and resourcefulness as a software engineer. By addressing deprecated components, adapting to changing API documentation, and enhancing functionality, I have showcased my ability to overcome challenges and deliver high-quality results. This experience has enriched my skills and positioned me to contribute effectively in future projects requiring problem-solving, research, and meticulous decision-making.
