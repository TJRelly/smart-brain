# SmartBrain

Face Recognition App made with MERN stack.

I'm using:
- [MERN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack): MongoDB, Express, React, Node.
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/): As CSS Framework for the styles and responsiveness.
- [react-tilty](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tilty): For the tiling [animation](https://codesandbox.io/s/73rqoq599j?fontsize=14&file=/src/index.js:0-27) on the logo
- [particles.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tsparticles): For the background [animations](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) and interactivity.

- [x] Interactive background: Click on the background to see what it does!

*Coming soon:*
- [ ] Node & Express Backend server to manage the users.
- [ ] MongoDB database to store the user's info.

Challenges: 
ZTM final project - This project was not a straight forward tutorial. The original project uses deprecated components that the learner is expected to correct. I selected different npm components based on ease of use, clarity of documentation, and cleaness of code.  These factors should make maintanence easier and quicker. I tinkered with the new components until I could match the functionality of the goal project.

### Page deployed!
A teaser is deployed [here](https://markelca.github.io/smart-brain/), the **accout authentification features are not working** and **more AI modes will be added** too.
